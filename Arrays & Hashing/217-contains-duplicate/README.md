This code checks whether an array of numbers contains duplicate elements or not.

It does so by utilizing a Set data structure, where elements that have been checked are stored. The loop iterates through each element in the array, and at each iteration, it checks whether the element is already present in the Set. If it finds a duplicate element, it returns "true"; otherwise, it adds the element to the Set.

Finally, if no duplicate elements are found, it returns "false".

This approach ensures efficient detection of duplicates by taking advantage of the constant-time lookup complexity of Sets.
